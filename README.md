# IEC-IDMT
--Trip time calculation as per various IDMT Curves can be calculated
and is embedded with a facility to generate a Graph which
represents the Trip Time against respective Plug Multiplier Setting
(PSM)
--User can compare the Relay Trip Time output with theoretical
values in a single graph along with the deviation value in
percentage for "Numerical Over Current and Earth Fault Relays â€“
PNA 442 Series".
--The application is also equipped with a feature to auto generate
graphs for a specified IDMT Curve which can be used in product
presentations at various forums.
--It is a web application having very minimal hardware and software
prerequisites to operate.
